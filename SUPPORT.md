## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I play TubeGuesser?

TubeGuesser shows you Tube lines, and you need to guess which London Underground station they belong to. You have 5 guesses to get it right! Use the hints if you get stuck - they'll show you trivia about the station or its location on a map.

### Why can I only play one game per day?

Free users get one daily game to keep the challenge fresh and exciting! Want to play more? Upgrade to Premium for unlimited daily games.

### What does the Premium subscription include?

Premium subscribers get:
- Unlimited games every day
- No daily limits - play as much as you want
- Advanced statistics and tracking
- Priority access to new features
- 7-day free trial to try it out!

### How do I manage my subscription?

Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID:
1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap "Subscriptions"
4. Select TubeGuesser
5. Here you can cancel, change plans, or manage renewal settings

### How do I cancel my free trial?

You can cancel your free trial at any time through your iPhone Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions → TubeGuesser. If you cancel during the trial period, you won't be charged.

### I purchased Premium but it's not working. What should I do?

Try these steps:
1. Close and reopen the TubeGuesser app
2. Check your internet connection
3. In the app, tap the Premium/Crown icon and use "Restore Purchases"
4. Restart your device
5. If the issue persists, contact us at [milesbennett90@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:milesbennett90@yahoo.co.uk)

### Will my statistics be saved if I delete and reinstall the app?

No, all game statistics are stored locally on your device. If you delete the app, your progress will be lost. We recommend keeping the app installed to preserve your stats and streak!

### I typed the correct answer but it didn't accept it. Why?

TubeGuesser is forgiving with spelling - it ignores punctuation, spaces, and allows for 1-character typos. Double-check the spelling of the station name. If you believe there's an error, please contact us with details.

### How often do you add new stations?

We regularly update our station database. Currently, we feature all multi-line stations across the London Underground and Overground network. Follow us for updates on new content!

### Can I request a refund?

All purchases are processed through the Apple App Store. To request a refund, visit [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com) and sign in with your Apple ID. Select TubeGuesser and follow the refund request process.
